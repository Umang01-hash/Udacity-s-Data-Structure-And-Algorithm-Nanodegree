Data Structures & Algorithms
In this course you'll learn data structures and algorithms by solving 80+ practice problems. you'll begin each course by learning to resolve defined problems associated with a selected arrangement and algorithm. By the tip of every course, you'd be able to evaluate and assess different data structures and algorithms for any open-ended problem and implement an answer supported your design choices.

Structure
Welcome
Get an outline of your program. Meet your instructors, and refresh your Python skills. Learn the framework to deconstruct any open-ended problem so understand the concepts of your time and space complexity.

Data Structures
Learn different data structures that may be accustomed store data. Implement different methods accustomed manipulate these data structures and examine the efficiency. Understand the benefits and applications of various data structures. find out how to approach open ended problems (either in interview or real-world) and choose appropriate data structures supported requirements.

Basic Algorithms
Learn and implement basic algorithms like searching and sorting on different data structures and examine the efficiency of those algorithms. Use recursion to implement these algorithms so find out how a number of these algorithms is implemented without recursion. Practice selecting and modifying these algorithms for a spread of interview problems.

Advanced Algorithms
Build on your algorithm skills by learning more advanced algorithms like brute-force greedy algorithms, graph algorithms, and dynamic programming which optimizes recursion by storing results to sub problems.
