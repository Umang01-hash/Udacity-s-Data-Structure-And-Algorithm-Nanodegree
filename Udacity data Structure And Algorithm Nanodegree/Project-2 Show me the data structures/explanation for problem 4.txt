The Active directory probelm is solved using the list[] data structure in python. 
The class Group has functions to add and get the users and groups simply. The empty list groups and users are also initialized here.
A function USerinGroup is there that accepts user -  string as well as group to check membership against as arguement.
the function UserinGroup returns the True/False if the user is found in group.

*The Group arg. can't be none
* Group arg must be Group type

Time Complexity:

O (n * m) -> iterating among m times per each n initial group


Space  Complexity :  -> O(n) -> being n the max recursion depth in the initial group
