			BLOCK CHAIN
Hashlib is used to calculate hash for all data and datetime to calculate the current GMT.
The calc_hash function calculates the hash value
and the _repr_ structures how the output will be presented.
the class BlockChain has the functions to add and represent the block by checking the conditions
It appends the block to the list and increments the lenth of block chain by 1.

The block to be added retreives the block's hash,which links them together.

TIME COMPLEXITY :
O(1) since all we are doing is adding blocks with statements.

SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(n) since I need to store all blocks in a blockchain list.
