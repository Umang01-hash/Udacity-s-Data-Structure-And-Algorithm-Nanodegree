Maintain 2 variables for the min/max values.

To find the min/max value in an un-sorted array, Linear Search algorithm was used:

Traverse the array from first to last index
For each element, compare against this min/max value, and if smaller than the min value, update this min value with the worth at this index. If larger than this max value, update this max value.
Upon completion, return the min/max values because the result.
Run time complexity
The logic completes during a single traversal, which is of O(n)

Space complexity
Linear search with in-place comparison was tired this algorithm. Constant space was used.

As a result, the space complexity if of O(1).
