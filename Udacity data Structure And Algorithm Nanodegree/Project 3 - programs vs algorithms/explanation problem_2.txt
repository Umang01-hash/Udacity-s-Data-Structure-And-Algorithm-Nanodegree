Data Structure used == Array!
The Function rotated_array_sorted takes arguement array and the target number to search and 
in return give a recursive call to function RecursiveArraysearch that takes the array , target number,start index and last index as arguement.
The function RecursiveArraysearch first compares the logical condition if start index is > last index and return -1 if the condition is true.
If the above stated condition is flase the function uses the divide and conquer technique to sort the array suing recursive calls.

       Time and Space Complexity

      Append operation in arrays takes O(n) being n the number of blocks 
      runtime complexity -  O(log n).
