Problem 5
For this trie i made a decision to use a defaultDict to store the youngsters which made for cleaner looking code.

Find Method
Time Complexity: O(n)

Each character has to be iterated through

Space Complexity: O(1)

No memory is allocated

Insert Method
Time Complexity: O(n)

Each character has to be iterated through

Space Complexity: O(n)

n characters must be allocated

Suffixes Method
Time Complexity: O(n)

Each character has to be iterated through

Space Complexity: O(1)

No memory is allocated
